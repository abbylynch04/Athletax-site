    <h1>The Story of Athletax</h1>
    <p>My name is Abby Lynch. I'm a CPA candidate and former Division I soccer & track athlete at the Unversity of Illinois, and I started Athletax to help college athletes understand and manage their taxes. Especially for those earning income from NIL deals or revenue-sharing opportunities, I understand firsthand how confusing the tax reporting process can be. My goal is to simplify your lives and help you to focus on being a student-athlete, which is already hard enough.</p>
    <p>I want to make taxes approachable and stress-free for student-athletes across the country. I have a passion for student-athlete engagement and advocacy, and I truly set up Athletax with the interest of student-athletes at the forefront of my mission. PLease reach out if there is anything I can do to help you, your teammates, or your athletic department.</p>
