    <h1>Meet Abby Lynch</h1>
    <p>I'm a CPA candidate and former Division I athlete at Illinois. I started Athletax to help college athletes understand and manage their taxesâ€”especially those earning from NIL deals or revenue-sharing opportunities.</p>
    <p>As a student-athlete myself, I know how confusing it can be. My goal is to make taxes approachable and stress-free for student-athletes across the country.</p>
